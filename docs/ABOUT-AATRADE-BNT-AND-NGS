Alien Assault Traders is based off of the original BlackNova Traders and Nova Gaming System code (specifically the .54 release of NGS). Their CHANGELOG information can be found in their project files.

This game started out as a fork from the Nova Gaming System and Black Nova Traders. We saw great promise in the game but thought the direction being taken by the original authors was too limited.

So we sat down and came up with many ideas that would foster long term gameplay and allow great expansion of the game.

We have added many new features that great expand upon the game that everyone has welcomed with open and eager arms.

- Avatars so players can personalize the game. Both built in and uploadable.
- Team Icons just like player avatars but you can have your own team badge.
- Debris that floats around the universe that can do either bad or good things when you pick them up.
- Nova Bomb that can devastate a planet or damage anything at the end of a warp link.
- Sector Genesis Devices where you can create your own sectors.
- Expanding Universe where the admin and set how often and by how much the univers gains new sectors as the game is played.
- Auto Purging that purges old news, logs, dead and inactive players.
- Auto Trade Routes where you can buy a cargo ship for each planet and have it trade all four of your commodities to various ports automatically even while you are not online.
- Dignitaries that can be placed on your planet to manage population, production, credits and more.
- Auto Routes that will allow you to create preprogrammed routes to any sector.
- Presets can have descriptions telling about the sector they point to.
- Paged mapping system that shows what sectors are owned by the different teams as you find them.
- Enhanced bounty system that prevents high rank players from attacking very low rank players.
- Team Forums that operate just like any normal forum only they are completely private. Teammates can have unlimited threads and discussions going on. A great way to keep track of things everyone on your team has found.
- Space Probes that can search for many things and report them back to you or your team.
- Templating System that allows admins to install as many new templates as they want. The templates can completely change the look of the game with different graphics and layouts. The players can easily change their template at anytime with the click of a button.
- Plus many, many more things added to the game.

We have plans for many more additions and enhancements for the game and we are always open to suggestions. Be sure to visit our web site at http://www.aatraders.com.
