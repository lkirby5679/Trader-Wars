This version of Alien Assault Traders contains many 
new features like modularized Probes, dignitaries,
spies, artifacts and more where you can 
add any new item by dropping in a new module.

Make sure you have your database created and the 
name of the database, database user name and 
database password ready before you start to install
this package.  That information is required when
installing.

DO NOT INSTALL OVER AN OLD GAME! 

This is completely different code. If you are
wanting to use the same database and directory from
a 0.2x/0.3x game you should delete all of the old
0.2x/0.3x code and every 0.2x/0.3x table in the 
database before installing 0.40. 

These are completely two different beasts. You may
cause all kinds of weirdness if you try to install
0.40 over an old 0.2x/0.3x or older version of the
game.

We are using a special install package that should
prevent all of the permission issues of earlier
versions.

1. Create the directory where you want the game
   installed on your server.

2. Unpack the aatrade_0.40_release.zip.

3. You will find 8 files including this readme.
   Upload the install_aatrade_package.php and 
   all six aatrade_package files to the game 
   directory.

4. Once the files are uploaded you should run the
   install_aatrade_package.php program.  
   IE: http://www.yourserver.com/install_aatrade_package.php

Everything from this point on is pretty self explanitory.

The aatrade_package files are actually tar archives
without the .tar extension.  You can add this extension
and unpack each archive with your favorite unzip/untar
program.  I wouldn't recommend uploading an unzipped
archive to your server.  You should ALWAYS use the package
installer as it will avoid a myriad of permission issues.
