  Install

    To install phpFreeChat you need:

       *  A Web server (Apache, IIS, Xitami ...) with PHP (4 or 5)
       *  Write access on the Web server (SSH, FTP, or other)

    By default, you don't need a Mysql database because the system uses files
    to store messages and nicknames.

       *  Quick start
       *  Advanced configuration

    Quick start

    Using the setup (the easy way):

       1. Download phpfreechat-x.x-setup.php[23] (lastest version)
       2. Upload the setup script on your server into a browsable directory
          (public directory)
       3. Browse the script with your personnal browser, it should launch a
          setup, then follow the steps !
          Tip: remove the setup when the install is finished for security
          reason.

    Using the ziped archives (for those who havn't gzip module in their php):

       1. Download phpfreechat-x.x.zip (or .tar.gz for linux users)[24]
          (lastest version)
       2. Unzip the archive localy then upload the phpfreechat-x.x directory
          on your server into a browsable directory (public directory).
          Tip: if you have a SSH access I suggesto to untar the archives
          directly on the server usign tar xzf phpfreechat-x.x.tar.gz command.
       3. Give the write rights to phpfreechat-x.x/data/public and
          phpfreechat-x.x/data/private directories.
          If you are using FTP:
          CHMOD 777 phpfreechat-x.x/data/private
          CHMOD 777 phpfreechat-x.x/data/public

          If you are using SSH:
          chmod a+w phpfreechat-x.x/data/*

       4. Browse the phpfreechat-x.x directory with your browser and enjoy !

    Now you need surely to customize your chat. You can take a look at the
    example scripts in the phpfreechat-x.x/demo directory.

    Here is the minimum script required for your chat to work (inspired from
    demo1):

    <?php

    require_once "src/phpfreechat.class.php"; // adjust to your own path
    $params["serverid"] = md5(__FILE__); // used to identify the chat
    $chat = new phpFreeChat($params);

    ?>
    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
           "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
        <title>phpFreeChat demo</title>
        <?php $chat->printJavascript(); ?>
        <?php $chat->printStyle(); ?>
      </head>
      <body>
        <?php $chat->printChat(); ?>
      </body>
    </html>

    Advanced configuration

    The chat is usable using the default configuration but a lot of options
    can be tweaked to customize the chat. For exemple, to change the refresh
    speed to 2 seconds, copy/paste this piece of code:

    <?php

    require_once "src/phpfreechat.class.php"; // adjust to your own path
    $params["serverid"] = md5(__FILE__);
    $params["refresh_delay"] = 2000; // 2000ms = 2s
    $chat = new phpFreeChat($params);

    ?>
    [... copy/paste here the above HTML codes ...]

    Another example, to set the initial nickname to "guest" (this can be
    useful when the chat is integrated into a portal or a forum which
    provides the login/password), copy/paste this piece of code:

    <?php

    require_once "src/phpfreechat.class.php"; // adjust to your own path
    $params["serverid"] = md5(__FILE__);
    $params["nick"] = "guest"; // it can be useful to take nicks from a database
    $chat = new phpFreeChat($params);

    ?>
    [... copy/paste here the above HTML codes ...]

    Now for the full parameters list:

    serverid
         This is the only mandatory parameter. It is the chat server id, "its
         IP" (comparable to the server host in IRC) used to identify the
         chat. Two chat must have different serverid. If you don't know what
         to write, just try : $params["serverid"] = md5(__FILE__);
    nick
         If you have already identified the user (forum, portal...) you can
         force the user's nickname here, this will skip the "Please enter
         your nickname" popup.
         Warning : Nicknames must be encoded in UTF-8. For example, if you
         get nicks from a databases where they are ISO-8859-1 encoded, you
         must ocnvert it: $params["nick"] = iconv("ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8",
         $bdd_nickname); (of course, change the $bdd_nickname parameter for
         your needs)
         ("" value by default, means users must choose a nickname when s/he
         connect)
    title

         messages list.

         the data (messages + nicknames) storage destination. For a better
         explaination, see this FAQ entry[25].
         (auto-generated string based on the title parameter by default)

         request which asks the server if there are new messages to display.
         If there are no new messages, then a empty HTTP response is returned.
         ( 5000ms = 5s by default)

         Setting this to true will send a /quit command when the user close
         his window (doesn't work on Firefox). It's not set to true by

         page this event occurs.
         (false value by default)
    focus_on_connect
         Setting this to true will give the focus to the input text box when
         connecting to the chat. It can be usefull not touch the focus when
         integrating the chat into an existing website because when the focus
