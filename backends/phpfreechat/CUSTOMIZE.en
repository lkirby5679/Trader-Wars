    phpFreeChat was developped with an aim of simplicity and flexibilty.

    Setting it up is relatively simple. All parameters are centralized in an
    array and passed as parameters on the instantiation of the phpFreeChat
    object.

    We can thus :

       *  Customization of the overall appearance (colors, sizes ...)
       *  Customization of the smileys list
       *  Write a new command
       *  Write your own container

    Customization of the overall appearance (colors, sizes ...)

    You need to create a new theme (for example mytheme) :

       1. Create a directory: phpfreechat/themes/mytheme/
       2. Create a new CSS stylesheet:
          phpfreechat/themes/mytheme/templates/style.css.tpl.php
       3. Now insert CSS rules into this file, for example, to change the
          date/hours color to red:
          span.<?php echo $prefix; ?>heure, span.<?php echo $prefix; ?>date {
            color: red;
          }

          Notice: use the <?php echo $prefix; ?> to prefix the CSS classes
          selectors in order to keep compatibility if the prefix is changed
          later.
       4. Setup the theme parameter in your chat script:
          $params["theme"] = "mytheme";


    As an examples, see these demos: 1[23], 2[24]

    Customization of the smileys list

    Follow the above instructions for the theme creation. Then I suppose you
    have a directory phpfreechat/themes/mytheme/.

       1. Create a new smileys directory: phpfreechat/themes/mytheme/smileys/
       2. Insert ping, jpeg or gif smileys images in the folder for example :
          smiley1.png, smiley2.gif, and smiley3.jpg
       3. Create a file phpfreechat/themes/mytheme/smileys/theme and enter
          the keyboard to image mapping smileys' description, for example :
          smiley1.png :) :-)
          smiley2.gif :( :-(
          smiley3.jpg :D :-D :o)

          Each line begins with the image filename followed by the list of
          the string characters to replace by that image. Only use spaces to
          separate the smileys string matches.
       4. Setup the theme parameter in your chat script:
          $params["theme"] = "mytheme";
