This package will help you create your own web installer.
The PHP script installer can unpack a web-based installer
and the files to install and install it with one file. To
make a web installer you will need to open createinstaller.php
in your browser. Click next, than enter the path of the script.
Click next, next, next, than see it compile. Go open the file
install.php it created in your browser than follow than test it
in a new path-- see if it works. Distribute it, or customise it
to change the look. Than become a developer for the PHP script
installer project and help me develop a script that also
(here;s my todo list) configures your newly installed script,
popluate a database, download updates from the web, or install
from a file.
